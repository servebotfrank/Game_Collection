App created to help game collectors keep track of the games they are buying.

This is to be a stepping stone to learning how to create applications with Java with the goal of pushing this to the Google App store once completed.

I have slight experience with Java, but not terribly much and none with Android Studio. I hope to learn more about both as this project progress.

I got the idea of this project after watching a video about video game collecting by Youtube Creator Scott the Woz where he expresses frustration about having a hard time keeping track of what he already owns.
